# FUP-MIN-CUTOVER — audio-minutes pre-enable gates (feature merged, flag OFF)

Index entry: [follow-ups-open.md](follow-ups-open.md) · filed 2026-08-19 · status parked

Owner: lead + human. Before the pilot flag flips (runbook §6 checklist is authoritative):
- [x] **Remote `db push`** — ✅ DONE (discovered already applied; catalog-verified 2026-08-06:
      302/302 migrations incl. AFF `20260909*` + MIN `20260910000100–400`, all 13 MIN functions
      in remote `pg_proc` with expected `prosecdef`, `meeting-audio` bucket cap 524288000).
      The deployed-`main`-breaks warning is closed.
- [ ] **Cloud storage upload cap** — ⛔ **BLOCKED, human decision**: org `Rede Madre` is on the
      **Free plan** (checked 2026-08-06) → 50 MB hard cap; 500 MB needs a **Pro upgrade**, then
      raise the dashboard storage limit and record it in runbook §2 (blocker recorded there).
- [ ] **T5 manual smoke** — plumbing ✅ DONE 2026-08-06: `minute_generator/.env` + platform
      `.env.local` `MINUTES_*` share minted secrets; smoke doc authored
      (`docs/testing/audio-minutes-smoke.md` — was referenced by runbook §6 but never existed);
      §3 webhook probe → 401 ✓; local storage container live-verified at 512 MiB. **Run blocked
      on human**: fill `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` in `minute_generator/.env`,
      supply a 1–3 min non-medical pt-BR audio, flip `MINUTES_SERVICE_URL` :8891→:8000 for the
      session (smoke doc has the full recipe).
- [x] **QA r2 residuals R1 + R3** — ✅ fixed 2026-08-06. R1: accessible name is now
      `Anexar a um item: "<resolução>" a "<item>"` — unique per card AND the visible label is
      the prefix (closes the pre-existing WCAG 2.5.3 gap QA's prescribed format would have kept).
      R3: `server-only` reverted on `src/lib/audio-jobs/hmac.ts`; E2E helper imports the real
      `signCallbackBody` (D16 restored); `docs/backend-state.md` updated. MIN spec 10/10 green
      (chromium, fresh reset).
- [ ] **R2** — the ≥8-tests click-delivery anomaly: did NOT reproduce on the 2026-08-06 rerun
      (10/10 first-attempt); still owed one look on different hardware before the pilot.
- [ ] Env vars on the deploy target: `MINUTES_SERVICE_URL/_API_KEY`, `MINUTES_CALLBACK_HMAC_SECRET`,
      `MINUTES_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` (runbook §3) — mint NEW production secrets, never the local
      smoke pair; plus the service itself deployed (`docker-compose.coolify.yml`) with its DPA
      gates closed (runbook §6).
