# FUP-E2E-1 — RE-BASELINE `e2e:prod` (cross-phase, PO-ruled 2026-07-27) — **blocks nothing**

Replace the *"~18–27 expected failures"* folklore with a **named list**: run the suite on a clean
stack and classify **every** failure as `infra` / `deterministic-real` / `genuinely-flaky`, each with
an owner.

*Why:* **a count-shaped baseline is a hiding place, not a known-issues list.** FF-2's gate ran
762 passed / 55 failed; splitting by connection errors showed **52 were infra** (the
`supabase_vector` crash-loop class) and **3 were real and deterministic** — one of which
(**BUG-FF1-008**) had been red on every run since FF-1 and written off as baseline noise.

Make the triage step itself documented rather than reinvented per lead: **conn errors `> 0` = infra ·
`= 0` = real.** Also establish why batches terminate early — two reported "did not run" (11 and 39),
so raw totals misstate coverage in **both** directions.
