# FUP-QO-6 — oversight-toggle slow-confirm: **annoyance severity ACCEPTED provisionally (PO ruling 2026-08-07)**; open LOW priority, DB-vs-UI formally unclassified

Index entry: [follow-ups-open.md](follow-ups-open.md) · filed 2026-08-19 · status parked

**PO ruling 2026-08-07 (D-FUP-6b):** after 16 total trials with 0 recurrences (15 isolated +
1 full-load gate with a continuous ~12,100-sample out-of-process poller — see the Test Run
Summary row), the stale-UI (annoyance) assumption is **accepted provisionally for the pilot**.
The lost-write question stays formally open at LOW priority; nobody manufactures a
classification. If it recurs, the recorded next step is a targeted 20–30× repeated-trial run
of the D9 test alone under artificial contention with a **sub-second** poller (the ~1.6 s
interval aliases past the flip — proven this run). ⛔ The original "do not fix by raising the
timeout" stands. Original record + diagnostic history below.

### the oversight toggle intermittently fails to confirm within 10 s; DB-vs-UI unclassified

Found by `tester` once its restore check stopped trusting optimistic client state. **Pre-existing —
not introduced by QO·A, and invisible until now BY CONSTRUCTION**: the previous check read
`CommissionOversightToggle`'s optimistic value, which updates synchronously before the server action
starts, so it reported success every time regardless of what the server did. Making the check honest
is what surfaced this.

**Signature (consistent, ~3 failures in ~13 early attempts, ≈23%):** a failing run takes **~11.5 s**
against **~2.5–3.0 s** on a pass — the reload-based assertion burning its full 10 s timeout. So the
confirmation is *not* being read too early; the state genuinely is not observable within the window.

⚠ **The decisive fact is NOT established.** At the moment of failure, is the DB correct with the page
stale, or **did the write never land**? That distinction is the whole severity question: stale UI is a
known annoyance here, but an intermittent write failure means **D9's governance control silently
no-ops ~1 in 4 times** and an admin would believe a committee is under oversight when it is not.

A bounded diagnostic (15 isolated runs + an out-of-process ~1.4 s DB poller, 216 samples) came back
**15/15 PASS — unreproduced**. The only `excluded` readings were the expected mid-test transients of
passing runs. `tester` stopped at the bound rather than extending, and reported the absence of the
fact instead of manufacturing one.

**The streak is itself evidence.** P(0 failures in 15 trials) at a constant 20–25 % rate is ~1.3–3.5 %.
The likeliest reading is that failures **cluster with environmental contention** rather than being
independent per-trial draws — the diagnostic ran isolated and unloaded. Consequence for the gate:
`RETRIES=1` retries moments after the first attempt, i.e. under the *same* conditions, so the naive
~6 % residual-spurious-red figure is an **optimistic floor, not a ceiling**.

⛔ **Do not "fix" this by raising the timeout** — that hides precisely the question above. Next step is
to reproduce under **load** (during a full `e2e:prod` run, not in isolation) with the out-of-process
poller attached, then classify. In-browser instrumentation is useless here: it perturbed the measurement
(6/6 green with logging on, recurrence once removed).

**F6 result (2026-08-07, tester, under real full-gate load): still NOT REPRODUCED.** `quality-oversight.spec.ts`
ran once inside the full `e2e:prod` gate (batch 16, 87-file suite, `RESET=1`); all 4 D9/D10 toggle tests
passed clean — WRITE PATH 1.5s, READ PATH 1.6s, D10 WRITE 1.3s, D10 READ 1.9s, none near the ~11.5s
failure signature. The out-of-process DB poller (docker-exec psql against `commissions.quality_oversight`,
~1.2–1.6s interval, continuous 13:52:44–16:12:5x UTC, ~12,100 samples, 0 gaps) recorded **zero `excluded`
samples for `ccih`** across the whole batch-16 window — the WRITE-PATH test's flip + `finally`-block revert
completes faster than the poller's sampling interval, so this is aliasing (too fast to catch), not a
failed-to-flip signal; the DB row that WAS sampled around the test window read `visible` with a fresh
`updated_at` consistent with a clean, fast round-trip. Extends the non-reproduction streak to 15 isolated
+ 1 full-load run, 0 failures. **The severity question remains formally open** — this run did not supply
a failure to classify, and no classification is manufactured in its absence. Evidence + poller logs:
`docs/../PROGRESS.md` Test Run Summary (2026-08-07, "QO·FUP F6"); raw poller logs are in the tester's
scratchpad (not committed — out-of-band per the task's own instruction), `oversight-samples.log` /
`oversight-samples-resume.log`.
