# FUP-BACKLOG-ETH-E1E2-INHERITANCE-GAPE1123-MINORAB — ETH·E1 → ETH·E2 inheritance (PO-directed 2026-07-14: "log for E2, don't act now")

Three **known gaps** + two QA Minors, all the same class — *pre-existing scope decisions E1 does not own*, made
**visible** by E1's stricter access model. QA and `backend` independently judged each out of E1's scope; the PO
agreed and routed all of them to **ETH·E2**. **Full reasoning, measurements and the QA quotes →
[eth-e1-access-spine.md §4](../progress/eth-e1-access-spine.md)** (detail rotated there 2026-08-04; titles +
owners kept live here).

- [ ] **GAP-E1-1 — `action_items` `assignees_only` arm never consults `can_read_case`** (a respondent who is also
  an `org_admin` could see an assignees-only item on their own case). `backend` at E2.
- [ ] **GAP-E1-2 — `patient_safety_event` has no case arm**; residual is **link-existence inference only** (the
  event carries its own incident narrative, not case deliberation). Gating it would rewrite the NSP/PHI-module-1
  model E1 doesn't own. `backend` at E2.
- [ ] **GAP-E1-3 — privileged-doc ceiling has no coordinator arm** (UX, not security: the coordinator who uploads
  a privileged doc must self-grant clearance to reopen it — correct per ADR 0072 D5). `frontend` at E2/E3.
- [ ] **MINOR-A — the generic leak sweep can pass VACUOUSLY** (10/14 covered, 4/14 vacuous). Fix: report zero-row
  tables as **uncovered** rather than silently passing them. `backend` at E2.
- [ ] **MINOR-B — `action_items` passes the sweep by FIXTURE ACCIDENT, not documented exclusion** — the moment
  someone seeds an `assignees_only` item it fails and reads as a regression. **Make it a decision, not an
  accident.** `backend` at E2.
- [ ] **participant-roles M2M (ADR 0072 D7·4) deferred to E2** — no §4 gate criterion covers it and its shape
  depends on E2's decision model; QA verified nothing half-built was left behind. `backend`.
