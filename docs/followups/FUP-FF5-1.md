# FUP-FF5-1 — patient-lane sublabel is degenerate on the READ path (**PO DEFERRED 2026-07-28**)

Index entry: [follow-ups-open.md](follow-ups-open.md) · filed 2026-09-02 · status open

The picker shows `Paciente / Paciente afetado`; the **durable submitted record** and wizard resume
show `Paciente / Paciente`. `buildReferenceAnswers`' input row carries no case data, so it resolves
the participant **type** while `reference_candidates` and `app.references_by_item` resolve the case
**role**. Every patient's `display_name` is the surrogate `'Paciente'` by construction, so **two
patient references in one case are indistinguishable in the permanent record**.

QA r1: **MAJOR, but ship** — every disambiguator that would work is PHI and would reverse ADR 0091
ruling 1 (which is why Rule 12 stays at three modules). The only mitigation that does not undo the
ruling is a **workflow rule**: require distinct `case_participant_roles` per patient per case.
Code fix (giving `buildReferenceAnswers` case scope) is a three-level PostgREST embed with PGRST201
exposure — both engineers independently judged it not gate-time work.

⚠ **The PO deferred the decision, not the risk.** The patient lane is live behind `entity_refs` the
moment FF-5 deploys, and ruling 2 makes that lane work **only** on case-bound forms — so this is
100% of real patient-lane usage, unexercised rather than unlikely. **Resolve before the lane is
offered to a real committee.**
