# FUP-SILENT-READ-1 — ~207 PostgREST reads never destructure `error` (2026-08-11, lead)

Surfaced during ETH·E4 when `tester`, enumerating the blast radius of the
`professional_profiles` column-list grant, noticed `getCaseDetail`'s professional embed
(`src/lib/queries/cases.ts:1358`) never destructured `error`. On any failure `profRows` is
null, `?? []` yields an empty map, and every professional participant renders with
`prof = null` — the roster silently falls back to the mint-time `display_name` snapshot,
`professionalProfileId` goes missing, and **`linkState` is undefined so the "Resolver
vínculo" affordance simply vanishes.** No error, no log, no visible failure: a deleted
feature that looks like an empty state.

**Fixed in-phase, all three ETH·E4-authored instances** (`7e55f01`): that embed, plus
`members.ts` `listLinkableOrgUsers` (an empty user list is indistinguishable from "no
account" — walking the coordinator to `no_account`, which makes the case exclusion
vacuously satisfied; the same class as QA's MAJOR-2, inside the very function written to
close the previous instance of it) and `vocabulary/actions.ts`
`listCaseParticipantRolesForAdmin`. ETH·E4-authored code is at zero.

**The repo-wide residue is this follow-up.** A cheap sweep counts **~207 of 773**
PostgREST destructures (~27%, ~40 modules — `rca.ts` 14, `capa.ts` 13, `referrals.ts` 10,
`cases.ts` 10). ⚠ **That is NOT a count of 207 bugs** and must not be cited as one. It is
pre-existing house style, and most instances are probably deliberate "return `null`/`[]`
on failure" reads. The ones that matter are only those where **an empty result is
semantically different from an error and the UI cannot tell them apart** — which is what
made the three above real. Separating those needs per-call-site judgement, not a regex:
the sweep is cheap, the triage is not.

⚠ The sweep script had a real bug before its numbers were trusted — line numbers were
computed on comment-**stripped** source, shifting every offset after the first comment.
Fixed by blanking comments length-preservingly (self-test 4/4); the count moved 210 → 209,
which is why ~207 is quoted as heuristic rather than audited. Script in `backend`'s
scratchpad. Owner: unassigned — needs a triage decision before anyone starts.
