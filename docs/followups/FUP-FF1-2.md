# FUP-FF1-2 — FF-1 QA non-blocking items (review r2: 4 MINOR / 6 INFO) — **7 still open**

Index entry: [follow-ups-open.md](follow-ups-open.md) · filed 2026-08-19 · status parked

All ruled non-blocking by `qa`. Detail rotated 2026-07-28 →
[ff-1-repeating-groups.md](../progress/ff-1-repeating-groups.md); canonical analysis →
[phase-FF-1-review.md](../reviews/phase-FF-1-review.md) (the playbook's rule: never restate a
review's rationale here).

Open: **MINOR-1** `completeness_authorities_agree` is one-directional in pgTAP · **MINOR-2** the
suite header documents a keystone that does not exist · **MINOR-3** MUTATION F3 names the wrong
mutation · **MINOR-4** stale-comment asymmetry in `supersede_response` · **INFO-2** no coherence
guard on the direct-DML path · **INFO-3** · **INFO-4** the parity vectors have no drift detector.
Closed: INFO-1 (superseded by MINOR-4) · INFO-5 (discharged at Record) · INFO-6 (carried forward as
a binding FF-2/FF-5 requirement — **both phases have since discharged it**).

> ⚠ MINOR-2 and MINOR-3 are the same family FF-5 hit eight more times: a comment or a test name
> asserting something that is not true. Cheap to fix, invisible to every gate.
