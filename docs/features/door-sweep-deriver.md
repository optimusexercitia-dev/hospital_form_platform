# DOOR-SWEEP-DERIVER — the diff-scoped sweep's case deriver

## Acceptance criteria

The unit closes **five** open follow-ups in `docs/followups/follow-ups-open.md`, each on its own
`Closes when` clause — quoted there, not paraphrased here. Nothing else counts as closure. Four
live in `scripts/door-sweep-cases.sh` (the §6 step-1 instrument every AE5 increment will run);
the fifth in the full-run emit path of the sweep harness that writes the committed baseline.

- [x] `FUP-DOOR-SWEEP-DERIVER-NAME-FILTER-DROPS-A-REAL-GATE` 🟠 — gates selected by a **property**,
      not a name filter (or the exclusions printed with their reason); `BASE=9a4bbd22^ TIP=9a4bbd22`
      must stop deriving zero cases. ⛔ Not by widening the filter to admit one name.
- [x] `FUP-DOOR-SWEEP-MARKER-BLIND-TO-CONTINUATION-LINES` 🟠 — the `door-sweep-targets:` parser
      consumes continuation lines, or rejects an unmatched continuation loudly; `20261003007250`'s
      three targets derive **from the declaration path**, provable with its `create or replace`
      lines removed from consideration. ⛔ Not by reformatting `…007250`.
- [x] `FUP-DOOR-SWEEP-DERIVER-BLIND-TO-ALTER-FUNCTION` 🟠 — `alter function … security definer`
      is grepped like `alter policy`, the altered function's return type resolved from the **live
      catalog**; a `prosecdef` flip on an existing boolean gate derives that gate.
- [x] `FUP-DOOR-SWEEP-DERIVER-SPANS-THE-WHOLE-WORKING-TREE` 🟠 — the deriver takes an explicit
      scope (migration-id floor or path prefix) **or** prints per-file provenance (committed-range ·
      working-tree · untracked), so a union can never again be recorded as one increment's
      coverage. ⛔ Not by dropping the working-tree/untracked sources.
- [x] `FUP-DOOR-SWEEP-FULL-RUN-DESTROYS-HAND-MERGED-ANNOTATIONS` 🟡 — a **full** sweep merges
      generated rows into `docs/reviews/authz-door-audit-findings.md` and the hand-authored
      material (the `<!-- … -->` subset block, the RENAME note, the skipped-policy annotations)
      survives byte-for-byte. ⛔ Not by extending the subset guard to full runs.
- [x] Every new selection/parse arm **proven able to fire** on its own reproducer (`9a4bbd22`;
      `…007250` declaration-only; a planted `ALTER FUNCTION … SECURITY DEFINER` on a boolean gate
      in a scratch migration never committed; a two-increment working tree; a full-run emit over a
      copy of the baseline), each paired with a clean negative control.
- [x] Gate: `npm run lint` green; `npm run test:db` on a fresh reset green; the four authz arms
      hold; the diff-scoped door sweep **not owed** (no policy or `prosecdef` gate changes — if that
      turns out false, it is owed, both arms — derived, for the first time, by the fixed deriver).
