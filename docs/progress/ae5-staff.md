## Session log

### 2026-09-13 — unit opened; peers cleared; register hygiene; stack up (lead)

**Ordering.** AE5 is post-pilot by ruling (ADR 0155 G1 / ADR 0162: *"AE0–AE4 gate the pilot. AE5 is
post-pilot."*). The PO instructed this session on 2026-09-13 to *"initiate implementation of AE5"*;
that instruction is the ordering event, recorded here so the ruling and the start are both on file.
Every pre-AE5 unit is `complete` in `docs/features/INDEX.md` at open (Batches 0–10, the two successor
ADRs 0207/0208, `AE5-ROLE-CATALOG-COMPAT`, `AE4-D-SHAPE-ASSERTION`, the three `DEFINER-*` units,
`VITEST-ROLE-SET-PIN`); `docs/plans/pre-ae5-remediation.md` § 6's last dated note (2026-09-13) names
nothing still owed before increment 1 beyond `AE4-D-SHAPE-ASSERTION`, itself `complete` in the index.

**Tree at open.** `main @ a02487bc` (*chore(graphify): refresh after the VITEST-ROLE-SET-PIN merge*),
`git status --short` empty, one worktree (the primary), no `*ae5*` branch local or remote,
`origin/main..main` = 162 commits (⛔ not pushed — the standing instruction; re-measure, never quote).
No `in_progress` hub before this one (34 hubs: 0 in progress · 3 gated · 2 planned · 29 complete).
`ListAgents`: 52 peer sessions listed, **all offline** — no shared-HEAD hazard at open
(`docs/worktrees.md` §1). Docker Desktop was **not running** at open; started by this session,
`supabase start` exit 0, then a fresh `supabase db reset --local` (its exit code is in the next entry).

**Review queue (per-clone, gitignored).** 8,488 B at open; two entries after the 2026-09-13
`AE4-D-SHAPE-ASSERTION` marker, both triaged, neither a doc problem, no CLAUDE.md edit:
- `d3fb6ddd` (`claude-md` + `staleness`, 15:07Z) — a subagent spawn prompt quoting CLAUDE.md §6–§7 /
  ADR 0186's hub-before-branch convention (hook finding (i)), and a review closing a MAJOR by a dated
  `⚠ Superseded` marker under a stale sentence (hook finding (iii): the register doing its job).
- `ea9ff6ff` (`claude-md`, 15:45Z) — the `VITEST-ROLE-SET-PIN` unit's own opening prompt citing the
  same convention (hook finding (i)).
Marker appended, entries removed; the file is 7,961 B after.

**Register hygiene found at open — one resolved entry never moved.**
`FUP-AE5-OPENING-ADR-0175-D3-FORWARD-PROMISE-UNDISCHARGED` sat `Status: open` in
`docs/followups/follow-ups-open.md:1884-1891` although its `Closes when` first arm — *"discharged (the
enumeration exists, per unit `AE5-MATRIX-ARM3-CELLS`)"* — was met on 2026-09-11: ADR 0175 carries
`✅ **DELIVERED 2026-09-11 …**` under D3 (`:92`) and `✅ **Delivered 2026-09-11**` under § Consequences
(`:161`), header `**Amended:** 2026-09-11 — dated markers only` (`:18`), commit `29422327`. Moved to
the archive tail in the standard closure shape (heading `— ✅ RESOLVED 2026-09-13`, closure note naming
the lag, the entry block verbatim with `Closes when` at column 0); body `cmp`-identical at the
destination before the source lines were cut; gate 7 exit **0**, gate 13 exit **0** (227 open ·
175 archived after the move). ⚠ The scout that found it also flagged that none of the five `ae5-*` /
`admin-arm-is-active` hubs carries a `## Current state` block — correct: all five are `complete`, and
`complete` FORBIDS the block (gate 13 HUBS arm); the live projection is
`docs/backend-state/authorization-and-audit.md` § Current state.

**Two more open follow-ups name AE5 and are NOT this unit's.**
`FUP-AE5-OPENING-ADR-CLASSIFICATION-COLUMNS-OWE-A-NAMED-CONSUMER` is sequenced **after** increment 1
by ADR 0203 D3 condition 2 (⛔ increment 1 may not cite D3 as licensing a read of the columns, 0203
`:332-337`); `FUP-AE5-OPENING-ADR-0176-NO-READER-LIST-STALE-AND-UNGATED` is a docs correction on ADR
0176, unrelated to the `staff` cutover. `FUP-GRANT-PLANE-CONVENTION-BUILD-AFTER-AE5` is parked until
AE5-complete (ADR 0205 D12).

**Sources read verbatim for the scope (not paraphrased):** plan § Phase AE5 `:1150-1290` — the
Proposed order (`:1198-1214`, item 1 `staff`), the ⚠⚠ `AE5-MATRIX-ARM3-CELLS` block (`:1216-1234`:
`case_reach` axis with mandatory `unreachable`, `arm3_divergence` label + 14th
`expected_legacy_granted` column, arms `arm9`/`arm10`, 1728 cells), the per-role checklist
(`:1248-1256`) and the five corrections (`:1258-1279`); ADR 0207 D5 (`:165-203`) + D6 (`:205-224`);
ADR 0201 `:421-426` (the three-deep template clause: ADR 0193 D5 · ADR 0200 · 0201 D3); ADR 0203
`:332-337`; ADR 0208 D3/D4. ADR numbering, if one is needed: highest on any live ref is **0210**
(measured across all local + remote refs) → next is 0211, re-measured at the moment of reserving.

## Task list (increment 1) — relayed verbatim to each owner in its spawn prompt

Drafted 2026-09-13 by a planning subagent from the plan § AE5, ADRs 0193/0200/0201/0203/0207/0208
and the AE4 artefacts as they exist on `main @ a02487bc`; every file:line below was cited by that
brief and is re-verified by the owner before it is acted on (LEARN-099: a location is a
measurement). Plan-approval level per lead-playbook §3 in brackets.

**backend**
- **T1 — `staff` permission matrix** → `docs/design/authz-ae5-staff-permission-matrix.md` (new).
  All planes (plan `:836-852`): the `memberships` CHECK + scope-shape row (`20260720000000:43-68`,
  commission tier = `staff_admin` + `staff`); every policy and function body reaching `staff`;
  mutation doors branching on the role; session partition / landing route; E2E. Method: the name
  matched **UNANCHORED ONCE**, each hit classified (`:845-852`); `.manage` split at reversibility
  boundaries (`:864-870`); look first at `app.can_manage_professional`'s header comment (ADR 0201
  `:425-426`). Per arm: subject + hat requirement; per row: `definerSurface`. AC: every row cites its
  plane and a live-catalog query; zero name-keyed family classifications; a § 6A-style asymmetry
  statement for `staff`. Witness: sweep transcript with bare exit codes, measured on the LIVE catalog
  (LEARN-057). [full plan review] → **PO approval AFTER** (the oracle event, plan `:857-859`).
- **T2 — deny-class effect table** → `docs/design/authz-ae5-staff-deny-class-effects.md` (new); the
  `403` 9-row shape re-derived for `staff` over `authz-matrix-axes.json` `denyClasses`; `403:29-34`'s
  two approved limitations restated or refuted by measurement. [one-line + ack] → PO approves values.
- **T3 — generators MULTI-ROLE** → `scripts/gen-authz-differential-cells.py`,
  `scripts/gen-authz-matrix-cells.mjs`, `supabase/tests/vectors/authz-matrix-axes.json`,
  `authz_differential_cells.psql`, `authz_matrix_cells.psql`, `authz-matrix-coverage.json`.
  `gen-authz-differential-cells.py:255` asserts one subject role and `gen-authz-matrix-cells.mjs:414-426`
  fuses `approvedSuites` ↔ `subjectRoles` both ways with ARM C1 on `authoritative − approved`, so the
  value cannot be swapped: the generator ranges over `["staff","staff_admin"]`, per-role `REPS`
  (each a code `staff` HOLDS, `:52-80`'s AE4.7c lesson), and the `role` axis enters `CELL_AXIS_COL`
  (the `:702` comment becomes false the day this lands — arm7 gains the column). AC:
  `npm run lint:authz-vectors` green; self-test asserts WHICH arm fired (LEARN-103); `arm9` binds
  the swept gate set to `openArms`; `arm10` holds the 14th column. [full plan review]
- **T4 — seed migration** `staff` grants + `update authz.roles set state='test_validation'`
  (mirrors `20261003007160`); `test_validation` is REQUIRED — `candidate_has_permission` sees it
  (`20261003007250:334-335`), `has_permission` sees only `authoritative` (`:283`). Plus the fixture
  gaps T13 lists (`seed.sql:632-637`: pending + deactivated are committee-less). AC: reset clean; 11
  rows, one `authoritative` + one `test_validation`; `403 § 3.2b` (`:575-585`) RED and RECORDED, never
  re-pointed; `410 § 7.2` (`:730-739`) RED until T5. [one-line + ack]
- **T5 — manifest** `approvedSuites.staff` (matrix · denyClassEffects · differentialSuite) +
  `hardDenyClasses` re-measured on every row `staff`'s bundle touches (ADR 0203 D1 bound 2) +
  a `staff`-shaped `layer1Gate` per row (⛔ not `app.holds_role_via_is_staff_admin_of`); `.psql`
  regenerated, never hand-edited (ADR 0200 `:243-244`). AC: `410 §§ 7.1/7.2` green; `§§ 7.3/7.4`
  (`:741-751`) 1 → 2 after observed RED at 1; the 40 zeros stay a search horizon. [one-line + ack]
- **T6 — atomic cutover migration** (mirrors `20261003007200` + `20261003007210:79-101`): ⛔ after
  R-1/R-2. `create or replace` only; four properties snapshotted/asserted (`20261003007210:117-119`);
  `staff` → `authoritative` with the count-verified `do` block; direct-call census per site from the
  comment-stripped catalog (`20261003007200:92-94`); ⛔ *"NEVER `legacy OR new`"* (`:33`) proven by a
  pgTAP grep; `405` extended; `401 § 3.2`'s tripwire (`:147`) fires by design. [full plan review]
- **T7 — re-key** (mirrors `20261003007300` / `20261003007340`, with the `-- door-sweep-targets:`
  header): layer-3 `app.can_*` per code with the literal greppable; manifest rows `pending-rekey` →
  `re-keyed`, four fields populated; DEFINER writers DECLARED on `definerSurface` with
  `carriesCode:false`, re-keyed instead where the policy is unreachable (ADR 0193 D5 `:88`; plan
  `:1252-1254` N4); new/touched DEFINER = `search_path = ''` (ADR 0208 D4). AC: `410 § 8` both
  directions; T12 flips every policy door both polarities; `414`/`419`/`421` + gate 18. [full plan review]
- **T8 — census + G8 arms** (`p0-authz-invariant.sh`, `authz-setvalued-targeted-cases.sh`, `401`,
  `409`, the findings baseline via merge only): arms re-derived per plan `:1073-1079`, each shown able
  to red; ⚠ `409:19-22`'s control (a) is a `staff` READ-site control — re-stated, never inherited, if
  T7 moves those sites. [one-line + ack]
- **T9 — runbook** `docs/deployment/authz-rollback-runbook.md` + `authz-rollback-template.sql`: a
  `staff` worked example beside § 6.2–6.5, both revert shapes (§ 2a / § 2b); ⛔ never a committed
  migration ([PA-F9], plan `:1002-1010`). [one-line + ack]
- **T10 — seam slice** `docs/backend-state/authorization-and-audit.md`: TWO edits (append the slice;
  REPLACE `## Current state` + re-stamp); Open-edges `:66-67` updated for step 6 still owed; gate 16
  check I. [one-line + ack]

**tester**
- **T11 — `424_ae5_staff_differential_oracle.sql`** (new): `403:17-20`'s two assertions per cell over
  `authz.candidate_has_permission` (`403:3-9`); `case_reach` incl. `unreachable`; `arm3_divergence`;
  `expected_legacy_granted` for approved divergence ONLY; shown able to fail by flipping one seeded
  `role_permissions` row; no shared ids across cases (plan `:1146-1147`). [full plan review] →
  **PO value per divergence CLASS before** (plan `:1233`).
- **T12 — `425_ae5_staff_rekey_differential.sql`** (new): the `409` shape — grant present vs DELETED,
  both polarities, on WRITES, DEFINER non-flippers named as a countdown (`409 § 2.10c`); observed RED
  on the PRE-migration catalog (plan `:1051`). [full plan review]
- **T13 — E2E + fixture-gap report** (`e2e/**`): one spec per scope-kind that a freshly-granted
  `staff` lands (BUG-HAT-001 class, plan `:1092-1094`); the `staff` personas end to end; the written
  gap list handed to backend for T4 (tester never edits `seed.sql`). AC: `e2e:prod` green once.

**qa** — **T14** `docs/reviews/ae5-staff-review.md`: checks the three-deep clause is satisfied AS
DATA, no count quoted rather than re-derived, every PA-F8 divergence dispositioned (a)/(b)/(c).

**frontend** — no task unless T7 changes a query/action signature or a landing-branch outcome.

**Gate list (AC-10)** — the arms, never the scripts: `census` · `hat` · `floor` ·
`FROMFINDINGS=1 wrapper`; door sweep predicate arm + policy arm (one invocation, `ARM-DOMAIN
predicate=N/127 policy=M/226` quoted); deriver `SCOPE:` verbatim, exit bare; set-valued
`ARM-DOMAIN setvalued=`; `SELFTEST=1` on deriver + door harness with `PASS · FAIL · SKIPPED`, the three
`--- GROUP` lines and `bash --version`; `RESET_EVERY` — ⚠ measured 2026-09-13 on harness TEXT:
present in `c2-command-door-neutralizer.sh`, `p0-authz-door-audit.sh`, `p0-authz-writepath-audit.sh`;
**0** occurrences in `p0-authz-rowdoor-audit.sh` and `p0-authz-invoker-audit.sh` (port, then prove);
NOTICED = evidence; CARRIED = a step.

## Open rulings — PO, before AC-6

- **R-1 — `staff` has no single-role wrapper to cut over.** Measured (planning brief, migration
  text — the backend re-measures on the catalog at T1): `app.is_member_of` / `is_member_of_for` are
  `app.is_active(uid) and app.has_role_any('commission', …)` — *"membership = ANY role in the scope …
  (staff ∪ staff_admin ∪ any future commission role)"* (`20260720000100:66-68`, bodies `:91-102`);
  `authz.holds_role` takes ONE `p_role_code` (`20261003007210:79-101`); no `is_staff_of*` exists in
  `supabase/migrations`. **Recommendation (the planner's, marked MINE there; not measured):**
  introduce `app.is_commission_staff_of(_for)` as `staff`'s wrapper and cut IT over to `holds_role`;
  re-express `is_member_of` as a disjunction of two `holds_role` calls only once both commission
  roles are `authoritative`; carry the decision in an ADR (next free number measured **0211** on
  2026-09-13, re-measured at reserving). ⛔ A PO ruling, not a lead decision.
- **R-2 — cutting `is_member_of` over adds a HAT gate it lacks today.** `holds_role` applies the
  active-role filter on self-checks (`20261003007210:110-114`); `is_member_of` carries no
  `active_role` term. A behaviour change across the largest call population (provisional text
  counts: 83 `app.is_member_of(` in 53 files, 123 `_for(` in 59 — migration text, LEARN-057) = a
  PA-F8 divergence to be dispositioned (a)/(b)/(c) **before the matrix is approved** (plan
  `:942-950`). Planner's recommendation: (b), a named compatibility exception with owner + expiry.
- **R-3 — the matrix itself** (AC-1) and the deny-class values (AC-2), on T1/T2's delivery.
